# After opening a Wireguard connection to your Fly network, run this script to
# open a BEAM Observer from your local machine to the remote server. This creates
# a local node that is clustered to a machine running on Fly.

# In order for it to work:
# - Your wireguard connection must be up.
# - The COOKIE value must be the same as the cookie value used for your project.
# - Observer needs to be working in your local environment. That requires WxWidget support in your Erlang install.

# When done, close Observer. It leaves you with an open IEx shell that is connected to the remote server. You can safely CTRL+C, CTRL+C to exit it.

# COOKIE NOTE:
# ============
# You can explicitly set the COOKIE value in the script if you prefer. That would look like this.
#
# COOKIE=YOUR-COOKIE-VALUE

set -e

if [ -z "$COOKIE" ]; then
    echo "Set the COOKIE your project uses in the COOKIE ENV value before running this script"

# Get the Fly app name. Assumes it is used as part of the full node name

echo Attempting to connect to $FULL_NODE_NAME

# Export the BEAM settings for running the "iex" command.
# This creates a local node named "my_remote". The name used isn't important.
# The cookie must match the cookie used in your project so the two nodes can connect.
